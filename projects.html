            Parrot is a multi-tenant serving system for various LLM applications. This project is
            done during my undergraduate internship in MSRA. As the project leader,
            I implement the core part and many important algorithms in the system. This system highlights
            the following techniques around the Semantic Variable abstraction:
            <ul>
                <li>Data pipelining and asynchronous communication between requests.
                </li>
                <li>Performance objective deduction and DAG-aware scheduling.

                    Relax IR is the new generation graph-level IR of the TVM compiler stack.
                    To train models in this IR, I developed an algorithm of automatic
                    differentiation
                    (AD) which is implemented as an IR transformation/pass.
                    Also, many useful tools (like loss function, Optimizer) are integrated.

                two different compilation courses. <br>

                (XC7A35T-ICPG236C).
                I modified the traditional framework of this course project so that it can
                operate two RAMs, which makes it possible to separate RAM into IRAM and DRAM. <br>
