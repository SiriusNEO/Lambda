                    I'm an undergraduate at
                    <a href="https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home">ACM Honors Class</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>,
                    advised by
                    <a href="https://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu">Prof. Yong Yu</a>.
                    Now I'm very fortunate to work with
                    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yuqyang/">Yuqing Yang</a>
                    in the System Group of
                    <a href="https://www.msra.cn/">Microsoft Research Asia</a>.
                    Previously I'm a research intern at
                    <a href="https://tvm.apache.org/">Apache TVM community</a>, working closely with
                    <a href="https://tqchen.com">Tianqi Chen</a> and
                    focusing on the
                    design of relax (a
                    graph-level IR for tvm)
                    training workflow. <br><br>
                    My research interest mainly lies in <span style="color: red;">computer systems and
                        architecture</span>, specially in aspects of: 1. Compute your bits (<b>MLSys</b>). 2. Store your bits (<b>DB</b>).
                    <!-- I enjoy crafting <b>systems</b> and/or exploring efficient <b>algorithms</b> to
                    bridge the gap between efficiency (low-level) and usability (user-side). -->
                    <br><br>

                    I believe there is no silver bullet in designing and architecting.
                    <!-- Hence
                    there is no perfect solution for all ad-hoc reallife problems. -->
                    However, I will try my best to narrow the gap between theory and practice, hoping that one
                    day <b>everyone</b> can appreciate and benefit from those great ideas in Computer Science.<br><br>

                    My commonly used ID/pseudonym is `SiriusNEO`. You can also call me "chaos"
                    as a homonym of my real name.
